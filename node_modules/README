If your module has a dependency, drop the libraries in this folder. Rename the
directories so that they match what the require() function calls for. For
example, if you need felixge's node-mysql package because it's required with
require('mysql'), you can cd to this directory and run:

git clone https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql.git
mv ./node-mysql ./mysql
