    Look at all "eval" statements in the code and determine if they're
    necessary. These slow things down, are bad JavaScript practice, and
    are often avoidable.
    
    Looks like (aside from JQuery) we only have one affected file. Here
    is some grep output:
    
    ./httpd.js:	if (eval("sys.handlers['" + moduleName + "']")) {
    ./httpd.js:		eval("var handler = sys.handlers['" + moduleName + "']");
    ./httpd.js:					eval("_exts['" + parts[j] + "'] = '" + parts[parts.length - 1] + "';");
    ./httpd.js:					eval("sys.handlers['" + details[1] + "'] = mods." + details[1] + ".handler;");
    ./httpd.js:				eval(varparts[0] + " = " + varparts[1] + ";");
    ./httpd.js:				eval("_errorDocs.e" + edocparts[0] + " = \"" + edocparts[1] + "\";");

    Outline new rules for contributions. While you're at it, come up
    with a decent version numbering scheme and do a writeup on it.

    Come up with a good way of modularizing logging and making it more
    available and customizable to other modules. Ultimately, the goal
    should be to get rid of logging.js entirely.

    Write a module for logging server usage statistics.

GradysGhost - 12 May 2012

    Come up with a good common "storage engine" scheme for modules to
    use. This should basically make server-side data storage abstract
    and arbitrary. For example, I should be able to put something in
    httpd.conf like "storage_engine=mysql" or "storage_engine=xml" and
    have any given module be able to call a function like
    "sys.storage.write(a_json_object);" and have that data written out
    in a coherent manner regardless of what the storage engine is.
