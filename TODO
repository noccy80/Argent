GradysGhost - 12 May 2012

    Outline new rules for contributions. While you're at it, come up
    with a decent version numbering scheme and do a writeup on it.

GradysGhost - 12 May 2012

    Come up with a good way of modularizing logging and making it more
    available and customizable to other modules. Ultimately, the goal
    should be to get rid of logging.js entirely.

    Write a module for logging server usage statistics.

GradysGhost - 12 May 2012

    Come up with a good common "storage engine" scheme for modules to
    use. This should basically make server-side data storage abstract
    and arbitrary. For example, I should be able to put something in
    httpd.conf like "storage_engine=mysql" or "storage_engine=xml" and
    have any given module be able to call a function like
    "sys.storage.write(a_json_object);" and have that data written out
    in a coherent manner regardless of what the storage engine is.
