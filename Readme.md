# Argent

## Introduction

Argent is a web application server built on Node.js. It is modular and designed with extensibility in mind. This software is made available as-is in the hopes that it will be useful to you, but comes with no warranty whatsoever. It is released under the GNU Public Licence, version 3. See Licence.txt for all the legal mumbo-jumbo.

If you decide to use Argent for a project, we'd love to know. Send us an email to let us know how it's being used because that's how nerds feel validated.

## Documentation

Documentation is provided internally as HTML files. See /your/argent/root/docroot/documentation/ for the files or browse to http://yourargentserver.com:12321/documentation/ when you have the default distribution of Argent running.

## Notes

I try not to push anything to this master branch if the software isn't running, but I'm not making any guarantees. As mentioned above, this software is presented as-is. It's open source so you can fix anything you find broken and hopefully tell me about it so I can work it into the main branch. My email address is listed here. This isn't the most organized programming team in the history of programming teams, but hopefully I can be somewhat available.
