## Introduction

Argent is a web application server built on Node.js. It is modular and designed with extensibility in mind. This software is made available as-is in the hopes that it will be useful to you, but comes with no warranty whatsoever.

If you decide to use Argent for a project, we'd love to know. Send us an email to let us know how it's being used because that's how nerds feel validated.

## Documentation

Documentation can be found in our wiki at https://github.com/GradysGhost/Argent/wiki/Home

## Notes

We developers try not to push anything to the master branch if the code doesn't run, but I'm not making any guarantees. As mentioned above, this software is presented as-is. It's open source so you can fix anything you find broken and hopefully tell us about it so we can work it into the main branch. Official contact information is listed on this github site. This isn't the most organized programming team in the history of programming teams, but hopefully we can be somewhat available.

## A note to contributors

This applies to you if you have rights to push to this repository.

If you are going to do some work, be sure to keep it in your own branch and merge upstream to master when it's running and functional. Please don't merge to master if your copy of the repo doesn't run. Also, please put your name or handle in the names of your branches. This allows us to look at each others' code and execute/debug it without losing our own code. It also can be used to let us know what you're doing with the code. A branch called `gradysghost-mod-logging` would indicate that I (GradysGhost) am working on a logging module. If you are checking the code out to work an issue (all issues should be logged on Github, by the way), put the issue number in the branch name.
